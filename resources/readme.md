# Databases and Versions

### Reasoning:
This reposistory is part of wider effort to create and maintain detailed and consistent functional annotation across several genome projects. To help maintain consistency and improve effciency a database versions are frozen. They can be updated as needed in your own versions, or at some later date for this version. The effciency saving step is that meta-data associated with a genomic hit is saved as between runs of the pipeline in pickle format, allowing for memoization leading to decreased look-up time the more times the pipeline is run.
